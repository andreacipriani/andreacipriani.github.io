If you need help with scaling up your iOS project and team, you can consider [hiring me as a freelancer](TODO=email:andreacipriani89@gmail.com)!

##### Why should you hire me

I have been working with iOS apps for more than 10 years, and have seen mobile apps at all stages: from startups with small teams to mid-size companies to "global scale" apps serving more than a billion users. 

I have seen different approaches to the most common "mobile problems" and learned what works best based on the context and company stage.

I can offer strategical consultancy – for example: how to setup a hiring process to maximize talent, how to modularize the codebase to go from 10 modules to 100 – or more "hands on", for example in 2024 I was hired for a few days to setup a new project using [Tuist]([https://](https://tuist.io/))/[TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).

##### Some of the topics I could help you with

- Scaling your architecture
- Improving your build infrastructure
- Shrinking your startup time
- Controlling your UI from the backend
- Sharing code between Android and iOS
- Integrating AI on your app
- and more...
