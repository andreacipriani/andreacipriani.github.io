On my ~~blog~~ [notes](/blog), I'll dive into topics related to work (Software Engineering) as well as my personal musings on the world around me, like reviews of my favorite movies and topics that recently caught my attention.

Here is what I'm preparing and should be coming next:
- An analysis of the odds of winning at Blackjack by counting cards using [Montecarlo simulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method). Is it really as favourable as the movie "21" make it look?
- My thoughts on the complete multiverse in "Everything Everywhere All at Once"
- A reflection on how the pay system in [FAANG](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=FAANG) is pure gambling
