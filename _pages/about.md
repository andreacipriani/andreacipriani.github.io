Ciao! I'm Andrea, an Italian Software Engineer based in nyc. I specialize in **mobile development** at scale, with a decade of experience in **iOS**.

Throughout my career, I have had the privilege of working for apps used all over the globe, including **Spotify**, **Google** and SoundCloud.

When I'm not coding, I love exploring new places and traveling, Hawaii is my favorite so far! I fenced professionally in my twenties and now I enjoy casual (mostly racket) sports, taking a dip in the ocean, testing my skills at Texas Hold’em poker and appreciating beautiful things.

You can get to know me here. Read about some of the [projects](/projects) I've worked on, look at my [cv](/cv/) if you consider [hiring me](/news/hire-me/), leave a comment on my [notes](/notes/) and learn what some of my favorite things are, including [movies](/movies/), [books](/books), [quotes](/quotes/) and... the best [pizza in nyc](/spots/) :)
