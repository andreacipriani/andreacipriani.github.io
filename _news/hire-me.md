If you need help with scaling up your iOS project and you would like a consultation, [send me an email!](mailto:andreacipriani89@gmail.com)

##### Why should you hire me

I have been working with iOS apps for more than 10 years, and have seen mobile apps at all stages: from startups with small teams, mid-size growing companies to "global scale" apps serving more than a billion users. 
During this decade spent on mobile development, I have seen different approaches to the most common "apps problems" and learned what works best based on the context and company stage.

I can offer strategical consultancy – for example: how to setup a hiring process to maximize talent reach, how to modularize the codebase to go from 10 modules to 100 – or can help directly with "hands on" tasks, for example in 2024 I was hired for a few days to setup a new project using [Tuist](https://tuist.io/)/[TCA](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture).
