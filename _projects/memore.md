One of the ideas I have been thinking about for a long time is _Memore_: a product to improve yourself in a data-oriented way, with the support of an AI coach.

When it comes to self-improvement, there's a whole world out there buzzing with startups, products, podcasts, and books, each offering its own unique take on the journey to becoming our best selves.
For example, forming strong *habits* has been a big trend in the latest years. Look at the success of books like "Atomic Habits" - it's been flying off the shelves and even spawned its own [iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/atoms-from-atomic-habits/id6474421906).
Also, tech support for Health and Fitness is constantly evolving and had its highest peak during the pandemic. From... to folks like Bryan Johnson pushing the limits by tracking every conceivable health parameter to keep their biological age as low as possible.
Last, the boom of genAI, life coaching/therapy have been among the most common examples where LLMs could do a great job into poking us to do the right things.

And while habits, fitness/health and general well being space, they seem to be often approached one at a time by startups. I think that self-improvement can be at the intersection of all of this, and benefit from the help of a digital coach.

Starting from the name: [Memore in Latin](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/memore) means someone "retaining the memory", that is collecting all the data we can about ourselves - in a private manner -
If you read Memore in English, it's "Me, more" - that is the effect of using the data to set up good habits and make a better version of ourselvs. I love this name for the idea and reserved a domain for it www.memore.ai

I think we are missing the opportunity of collecting the most important data, the data about ourselves and our life. While wearables started collecting some of it, mostly related to fitness and health, and [whoop](https://www.whoop.com/) brought data analysis and coaching to the next level, there is still plenty of important metrics that we are missing and a category of which requires manual data and are hard to track.

One example is your daily mood, potentially the ultimate metric you want to optimize for. Apple has recently added a feature for tracking mood in the Health app, but I don't think they found a way of making this an engaging experience.

Having this data available to a private AI, and asking the user to set their goals and habits that want to keep, could improve us and our lives. From health, fitness, to sticking to good habits, to reaching our goals and ultimately running tests to understand.

As an example, 

The steps:

 1. Collect data about your life, health and habits in a private and automated way. Integrations with wearables and external systems
 2. Collect manual data via chat for habit tracking, mood
 3. Improve yourself with an AI life coach: smart motivational customized messages at the right time. Make informed decisions, stick to your habits and reach your goals.
 4. Run the equivalent of A/B testing on yourself. Do I improve my mood by avoid more than X hours of screen time? Do I sleep better when I go to the gym? What is too much social activity for me in a week?
