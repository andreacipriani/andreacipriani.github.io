While working on Veecards' launch – in Italy between 2013-2016 at [Code Atlas SRL](https://www.codeatlas.it) – we decided to build [Veer](http://www.veecards.com/veer): a companion app to support the interactions with your favourite contacts.

Watch an intro video:

        <img src="https://img.youtube.com/vi/iDONNApxGxA/maxresdefault.jpg" style="width:100%;">
        <div style="position: absolute; top: 50%; left: 50%; transform: translate(-50%, -50%);">
            <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="100" height="100" viewBox="0 0 24 24">
                <path fill="#ffffff" d="M3 22v-20l18 10-18 10z"/>
            </svg>
        </div>
    </a>
</div>

[Veer](http://www.veecards.com/veer) is a simple app and widget to interact with your favourite contacts through your most liked applications.

Engineered with user comfort in mind, the Android version emphasizes ergonomic design, enabling effortless navigation with just a thumb's movement.
On iOS, Veer pioneered widget functionality, seamlessly integrating with the notification center and allowing a "one-tap" interaction with the user's favourite contacts.

<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/veer-android.png" title="Veer on Android" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/veer-ios1.png" title="Veer on iOS contacts" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid loading="eager" path="assets/img/veer-ios2.png" title="Veer on iOS actions" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>

While Veer was relatively smaller in scale compared to Veecards, it garnered some media attention [[1]](https://androidguys.com/reviews/app-reviews/veer-contacts-widget-app-review/)[[2]](https://www.tech-wd.com/wd/2015/12/30/veer/) and achieved a top 25 ranking for _Utilities_ in several countries.
The development phase incorporated integration of in-app purchases, enabling users to expand their contact list and access additional actions.
