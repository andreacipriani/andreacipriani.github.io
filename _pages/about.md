Ciao! I'm Andrea, an Italian Software Engineer based in nyc and I specialize in mobile development at scale and iOS.

When I'm not immersed in code, I love exploring new places, playing (racket) sports – I fenced for a long time – taking a dip in the ocean, testing my skills at Texas Hold’em poker and appreciating culture and arts.

You can get to know me here. Read about some of the [projects](/projects) I've worked on, look at my [cv](/cv/) if you consider [hiring me](/news/hire-me/), leave a comment on my [notes](/notes/) and learn what some of my favourite things are, including [movies](/movies/), [books](/books), [quotes](/quotes/) and... my favourite pizza in nyc :)

On my ~~blog~~ [notes](/blog), I'll dive into topics ranging from software engineering to reviews of my favorite movies and books. Here is what's coming next: I'll analyze the odds of winning at Blackjack by counting cards, share my thoughts on the complete multiverse from the movie "Everything Everywhere All at Once" and a reflection on how the pay system in [FAANG](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=FAANG) is pure gambling.
